# ToDo

- [X] In parentheses on the tooltip for bodily fluids, define what it means
- [X] Fix link css for header, but not for case stats.
- [X] Add a "Can be passed from mother to child during pregnancy/birth" section
- [X] fix bold stuff
- [X] write in chlamydia, gonorrhea, and other sections about the passing to child stuff
- [X] @Frances-- be more specific with the "360,000 cases each year". When I was doing one, I saw planned parenthood get a statistic wrong, so we really need to figure out whether that's global, the US, new cases? total?
