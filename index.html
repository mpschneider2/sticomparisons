However, it's easily curable with antibiotics. It often doesn't exhibit symptoms, which is why STI testing is important. Gone untreated, it can have negative long-term consequences. It is passed through the exchange of bodily fluids like semen, pre-ejaculate, and vaginal fluids. Thus, it is important to use barrier methods like condoms and dental dams any time one engages in oral, vaginal, or anal sex. It isn't spread through casual contact so you CAN'T get it from sharing food/drinks, kissing, hugging, holding hands, coughing, sneezing, or sitting on the toilet. </div>
