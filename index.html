    <p class="topdescription">Hover over the icons and any text with a dotted underline for a short explanation. If a column is empty, it means that the answer to the question is "no." For a more detailed summary, click on individual rows, and they will expand to show a write-up as well as sources. See any errors?

    <p class="topdescription">Below, the difference between "treatable" and "curable" is that "curable" means that the infection can completely go away with medicine. On the other hand, "treatable" means that only the symptoms can be taken care of, and nothing can be done about the underlying infection. Some STIs are not curable with medicine, but for a portion of the population, they do go away by themselves.</p>

The most common age group is 14-24 years old. However, it's easily curable with antibiotics. It often doesn't exhibit symptoms, which is why STI testing is important. The few times there are symptoms, they are things like: a burning sensation while peeing, and abnormal discharge from the penis/vagina. Gone untreated, it can have negative long-term consequences, such as permanent damage to the female reproductive system. It is passed through the exchange of bodily fluids like semen, pre-ejaculate, and vaginal fluids. Thus, it is important to use barrier methods like condoms and dental dams any time one engages in oral, vaginal, or anal sex. It isn't spread through casual contact so you CAN'T get it from sharing food/drinks, kissing, hugging, holding hands, coughing, sneezing, or sitting on the toilet. </div>

                        <div class="elaboratedescription">Genital warts are an infection caused by some types of HPV (human papillomavirus). They do NOT cause cancer if left untreated, unlike other types of HPV. 
                            They are spread through skin-to-skin contact with someone who’s infected — often during vaginal, anal, and oral sex — and can be spread even when there are no symptoms. 
                            Condoms and dental dams can help prevent infection. If there are visible warts, however, condoms and dental dams will not provide reliable protection — they might not cover all the warts.
                            Symptoms may never appear, or they may appear between a few weeks to a few years after sexual contact with an infected person, so it can be difficult to track when and from whom you got the infection. 
                            If they do appear, genital warts can show up as small whitish or skin-colored bumps on the genitals or anus.

                            Genital warts can be treated by removing them, and there is also an HPV vaccine that can prevent most types of genital warts.

You CAN'T get it through sharing food/drinks, kissing, hugging, holding hands, coughing, sneezing, or breastfeeding.

                            <span class="bolded">Description:</span> Hepatitis B is an infection that can cause liver disease. Of hepatitis A, B, and C, it is the most common to be spread through sex. To protect yourself, you can get the hepatitis B vaccine and use condoms. There is no cure for hepatitis B, but 90% of adults who get hepatitis B make a full recovery (acute infection). However, about 1 in 20 adults who get hepatitis B become carriers, meaning they have a chronic infection and may continue to spread hepatitis B for the rest of their lives. Because of the toll it takes on your liver, about 1 in 5 people with chronic hepatitis B die from it. There are medicines you can take to treat chronic hepatitis, so talk with your doctor. While most of the time, there aren’t symptoms, common ones include: tiredness, belly pain, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, joint pain, headache, fever, hives, etc. When in doubt, get tested!

                            While these symptoms are common, most of the time, there are no symptoms, meaning people don't know that they have it. It's a very common infection that stays in your body for life, so more than half of Americans have oral herpes and about 1 in 6 Americans has genital herpes. It is spread through skin-to-skin contact with infected areas, often during vaginal, oral, and anal sex, as well as kissing. Unfortunately, this also means that a pregnant person can pass genital herpes to a baby during vaginal childbirth, but that's rare. Herpes is most contagious when sores are open and wet because the blister fluid easily spreads the virus (but it is still contagious even when one doesn't have sores). Using condoms can help reduce the risk of giving or getting herpes. You can't get herpes from hugging, holding hands, coughing, sneezing, or sitting on toilet seats, as the virus dies quickly outside the body. While it can’t be cured, it can certainly be treated and managed. Besides herpes medicine, treatments for outbreaks include the generic pain-relief methods such as: taking a warm bath, keeping the genital area dry, wearing soft, loose clothes, using an icepack on sores, and taking aspirin/acetaminophen/ibuprofen.

                            <span class="bolded">Symptoms:</span> Apart from flu-like symptoms (fever, aches, feeling sick) 2-4 weeks after infection, HIV often doesn’t have symptoms. Once it progresses to the later stage of HIV (AIDS), symptoms can include sore throat, fever, chills, rash, night sweats, muscle aches, fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, and mouth ulcers.<br><br>
                            <span class="bolded">Treatment and prevention:</span> Treatment of HIV is a combination of medicines called antiretroviral therapy that slows down the effects of HIV and can also lower (or even stop) your chances of spreading it. PEP is a series of pills that use ART medications to lower your chances of getting HIV if you take it very soon after you’ve been exposed (within 72 hours, or 3 days). Ways to prevent HIV include taking PrEP or avoiding “high risk” sexual activities.<br><br>
                            <span class="bolded">What is AIDS? How is it different from HIV?</span><br>
                            AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) is a stage of HIV that eventually leads to death. It occurs after HIV has destroyed too many CD4 cells, which are cells in the immune system that activate other immune cells to fight off the infection. It usually takes around 10 years for a person with untreated HIV to develop AIDS, but ART treatment can slow the damage of HIV, preventing AIDS from developing for several decades.

                            HPV, also known as human papillomavirus, is the most common sexually-transmitted infection. It is usually harmless and goes away by itself, but certain types can lead to cancer or genital warts. Because it lacks symptoms much of the time and goes away, most people who have had it don’t know that they have. And most sexually-active people get HPV sometime in their lives. There are over 200 types of HPV, 40 of which infect the genitals (vulva, vagina, cervix, rectum, anus, penis, and scrotum). Two types cause genital warts (these are considered low-risk, as they don’t lead to serious health problems like cancer), but over a dozen (high-risk) cause cancer. The symptoms, such as genital warts and cervical cancer can be treated. For more info on genital warts and how they’re treated, check out the “Genital warts” row. HPV is a common cause of cervical cancer, but it can also just cause cancer in one’s vulva, vagina, penis, anus, mouth, and throat. This is why regular Pap/HPV tests are important. While there isn’t a cure, there are vaccines that can help protect against certain kinds of HPV, and usage of barrier methods such as dental dams and condoms can reduce risk as well (but they don’t offer perfect protection). It is spread through contact between skin-to-skin contact of genitals (vulva, vagina, cervix, penis, anus) of one person, and the genitals/mouth/throat of another person.

                            Molluscum contagiosum is a viral infection that causes small bumps on the face, neck, arms, stomach, legs, or genitals. Molluscum contagiosum is spread through close contact 
                            with someone who has it — during sex or from touching clothes, towels, or toys. Both adults and kids can get it, and it’s also possible to spread it to other parts of your 
                            body by touching or scratching the bumps. Molluscum contagiosum bumps usually go away by themselves, or a doctor can prescribe a medicated cream or remove them for you using different methods (freezing, draining, or laser removal).
                            Molluscum contagiosum is spread through skin-to-skin contact, so using a condom does NOT prevent it; because of this, the best way to avoid it is to not have sex or skin-to-skin contact with someone who has it.

                            Pubic lice (crabs) are small parasites that live on coarse hair (often near your genitals) and feed on your blood. They are spread during sexual contact or other kinds of close, 
                            personal contact; they can also be spread through an infected person’s clothes, towels, or bed. They do NOT spread through quick, casual touching, like hugs, and it’s extremely

                        <div class="elaboratedescription">Syphilis is a quite common bacterial STI that is easily curable with antibiotics, but will cause permanent damage (such as brain damage, paralysis, and blindness) gone untreated. It can infect one’s vagina, anus, penis, or scrotum, (and sometimes the lips or mouth), and it is spread through skin-to-skin contact when an uninfected person comes into contact with the sores of an infected person. However, these sores, and other symptoms (like rashes), are extremely difficult to notice. Even when they are noticed, they often get confused with other things like pimples and rashes. These symptoms may come and go with time, but the ONLY way to get rid of syphilis is to take the medicine for it. To help prevent syphilis, barrier methods like condoms and dental dams should be used, even if neither partner is showing symptoms. Unfortunately, syphilis can also be spread to a child during pregnancy (congenital syphilis), which can lead to many complications. For more details on that, read the first link below.
