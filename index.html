                        <div class="elaboratedescription">Chlamydia is the most commonly reported STI in the United States, with over 1.5 million cases being reported in 2020. The most common age group is 14-24 years old. However, it's easily curable with antibiotics. It often doesn't exhibit symptoms, which is why STI testing is important. Gone untreated, it can have negative long-term consequences. It is passed through the exchange of bodily fluids like semen, pre-ejaculate, and vaginal fluids. Thus, it is important to use barrier methods like condoms and dental dams any time one engages in oral, vaginal, or anal sex. It isn't spread through casual contact so you CAN'T get it from sharing food/drinks, kissing, hugging, holding hands, coughing, sneezing, or sitting on the toilet. </div>

                            <b>Prevalence:</b> Estimated 850,000 people in the U.S. are living with hepatitis B, but only 25% of infected individuals are diagnosed.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>How it's spread:</b> Hepatitis B is really contagious-- it is transmitted through contact with semen, vaginal fluids, and blood, meaning that one can get it through vaginal, anal, or oral sex, sharing toothbrushes and razors, sharing needles for drugs, piercings, or tattoos, as well as getting it from their mother during birth. You CAN'T get it through sharing food/drinks, kissing, hugging, holding hands, coughing, sneezing, or breastfeeding.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Description:</b> Hepatitis B is an infection that can cause liver disease. Of hepatitis A, B, and C, it is the most common to be spread through sex. To protect yourself, you can get the hepatitis B vaccine and use condoms. There is no cure for hepatitis B, but 90% of adults who get hepatitis B make a full recovery (acute infection). However, about 1 in 20 adults who get hepatitis B become carriers, meaning they have a chronic infection and may continue to spread hepatitis B for the rest of their lives. Because of the toll it takes on your liver, about 1 in 5 people with chronic hepatitis B die from it. There are medicines you can take to treat chronic hepatitis, so talk with your doctor.

                            Herpes causes sores on the genitals and/or in the mouth-- it can be annoying and painful but often doesn't lead to serious health problems. While these symptoms are common, most of the time, there are no symptoms, meaning people don't know that they have herpes. It's a very common infection that stays in your body for life, so more than half of Americans have oral herpes and about 1 in 6 Americans has genital herpes. It is spread through skin-to-skin contact with infected areas, often during vaginal, oral, and anal sex, as well as kissing. using condoms can help reduce the risk of giving or getting herpes. Unfortunately, this also means that a mother can pass genital herpes to a baby during vaginal childbirth, but that's rare. Herpes is most contagious when sores are open and wet because the blister fluid easily spread the virus (but it is still contagious even when one doesn't have sores). You can't get herpes from hugging, holding hands, coughing, sneezing, or sitting on toilet seats as the virus dies quickly outside the body.
